Circuit Explanation:

* LDR and Voltage Divider:
The LDR is placed in series with a fixed resistor, creating a voltage divider circuit. When light hits the LDR, its resistance decreases, causing a change in the voltage across the divider circuit. 

* Arduino Analog Read:
The voltage from the voltage divider is read by the Arduino's analog pin (A0). This analog value represents the current light intensity. 

* Threshold Comparison:
The Arduino code compares the analog reading to a pre-set threshold value. If the reading falls below the threshold (meaning darkness), it triggers the relay. 
* Relay Activation:
When the threshold is crossed, the Arduino sets the digital pin (D7) to HIGH, activating the relay module. 
* Light Control:
The relay module is connected to the LED/bulb, so when activated by the Arduino, it switches the light on. 
* Key points:
** Light Dependent Behavior:
As light intensity increases, the LDR's resistance decreases, resulting in a higher voltage at the Arduino's analog pin. 
** Threshold Setting:
The threshold value in the code determines the sensitivity of the light detection. 
** Relay Function:
The relay acts as a switch, allowing the Arduino to control a higher power circuit like a light bulb. 


* Applications:
Automatic night lights, Street lighting with dusk-to-dawn functionality, and Light-activated sensors in robotics.
